I use Agile SW model in "Shop360: Immersive VR Shopping Platform" because:

Flexibility: Agile allows for changes in requirements based on user feedback and evolving needs.
Iterative Development: Features like virtual navigation, try-ons, and payments can be developed incrementally in sprints.
Customer-Centric Approach: Regular user involvement ensures the product meets expectations.
Rapid Delivery: Functional components are delivered at the end of each sprint for early testing and feedback.
Using Agile ensures that Shop360 evolves iteratively, staying aligned with stakeholder goals and providing a high-quality user experience.
